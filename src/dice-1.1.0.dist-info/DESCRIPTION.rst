A library and command line tool for parsing and evaluating dice notation.

Usage
=====

>From the command line::

    roll 3d6

>From python::

    import dice
    dice.roll('3d6')

Notation
========

The expression works like a simple equation parser with some extra operators.

*The following operators are listed in order of precedence.*

The dice ('d') operator takes an amount (A) and a number of sides (S), and
returns a list of A random numbers between 1 and S. For example: ``4d6`` may
return ``[6, 3, 2, 4]``.

If A is not specified, it is assumed you want to roll a single die.
``d6`` is equivalent to ``1d6``.

Basic integer operations are available: ``16 / 8 * 4 + 2 - 1 -> 9``.

A set of rolls can be turned into an integer with the total (``t``) operator.
``6d1t`` will return ``6`` instead of ``[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]``. Applying
integer operations to a list of rolls will total them automatically.

A set of dice rolls can be sorted with the sort (``s``) operator. ``4d6s``
will not change the return value, but the dice will be sorted from lowest to
highest.

The lowest or highest rolls can be selected with ``^`` and ``v``. ``6d6^3``
will keep the highest 3 rolls, whereas ``6d6v3`` will select the lowest 3
rolls.
